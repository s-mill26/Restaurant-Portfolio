# The project as a whole 
This portfolio project is based around a small fictious restaurant group that wanted to record all restaurant revenue data over a 6-month period to develop insights. Included are files that showcase how I organized the project, and decided on what metrics and questions that I beleive a real-world restaurant group would focus on.

This is the summary of my analysis and is used to showcase my findings as well as summarize the data in a non-technical way to showcase my work to a non-technical audience.
